# What is a computer? 

A computer is a machine used to process information

Model = simple

_Billions of light swithches_ 

Can be on (**bit = 1**) or off (**bit = 0**)

8 bits = byte (_any combinations of 1s and 0s_) 

**Binary arithmatic**
00001011

1011 = 11
8 + 2 + 1

2^3  2^2  2^1  2^0
1     0    1    1
8   +  0  + 2  + 1 = 11

**ASCII Table**
1 -> _
...
32 -> a
33 -> b
etc...

0 = +
1 = -

A program is a series of bytes that represents a series of instructions for the computer to do

**Grid**
Memory cell = specific row and colum
*Each program gets one rectangle of table called a stack 

*Heap = free-for-all loose memory, any program can use. Grab something out if needed

*Stacks = last in first out

*Every function run, a new chunk is added to the stack.  Loads instructions first, as well as primitive variables

Stack runs first

Objects: spacing isnt limited to how much space is needed to store a string.

Memory adress is stored inside the heap for objects

Adress for the Object is stored inside the Stack

Primitive is stored by value, Objects are stored by refrence

_Decloration: Variables must alwasys be declard_


Object => Refrence => Null
